                        <p> I'm Adrian Gallano, 17 years old aspiring self taught Software Engineer.</p>
                        <p> Since i was a kid i've always like building, creating and inventing things, 
                            eversince i discovered programming i was amaze on things you can do with only 
                            typing words, and then i started programming at 13 years old and stop within a
                            week frustated about how hard and complex it was, fast forward to 16 years old
                            i studied game development i build a few games with a friend as programmer.
                        </p>
                        <p> Hopping to 17 years old exactly at my birthday i got a new laptop from my 
                            sister as gift i started researching about web development and i was inspired
                            by brittanychiang's portfolio so i study and study till i was comfortable.
